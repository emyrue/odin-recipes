        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Lightly beaten egg</li>
            <li>Potato starch</li>
            <li>Sweet rice flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Rice flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prick each potato a few times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and pass through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Make a well in the mashed potatoes with a wooden spoon and pour in egg; mix well.</li>
            <li>Whisk potato starch, sweet rice flour, and salt together in a bowl. Sprinkle over potato mixture; stir until a soft dough has formed. Cut dough into 4 equal parts with a knife or pastry cutter.</li>
            <li>Dust work surface with rice flour to keep dough from sticking. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into 1-inch gnocchi. Gently roll each one with the back of a fork to create ridges. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Shake off any excess rice flour and let gnocchi rest, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi in batches and cook, without stirring, until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
